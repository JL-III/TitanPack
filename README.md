## How to Download the Resourcepack

#### This process is only needed if you do not want to use the `/resourcepack` command in game every time you log in. Using this method means you have to update the resource pack every time a new version is released.

1. Click on the releases on the right hand panel.  
2. Click on the latest version. This should start a download. It will look something like this `TheatriaPackvX.X.X-X.X.zip`  
3. Open your `.minecraft` directory on your computer. This is where your mods are located.
4. Add this zip file to your `/resources` directory.  
5. Launch Minecraft. When you are in game click on `options` and then click on `Resource Packs...`
6. Choose the version you just downloaded, double check your version.
7. That should be everything! You can check with if the textures are loaded by looking at a `Titan Tool`.  
8. Keep an eye out for new resource pack version releases to stay up to date!
