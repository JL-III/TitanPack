## How to Download the Resourcepack

#### This process is only needed if you do not want to use the `/resourcepack` command in game every time you log in. Using this method means you have to update the resource pack every time a new version is released.

1. Click on the releases on the right hand panel.  
2. Click on the latest version. The file you're looking for will look something like this `TheatriaPackvX.X.X-X.X.zip`. This should start a download.  
3. Open your `.minecraft` directory on your computer.  
4. Add this zip file to your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` directory.  
5. Launch Minecraft. When you are in game click on `options` and then click on `Resource Packs...`
6. Choose the version you just downloaded, double check your version since you might have several packs applied. Remove any old Theatria Resource Packs. If you have a resource pack you can't remove it is likely one applied via the command `/resourcepack` or `/titan pack`. Having this shouldn't cause issues but you can get rid of it by logging out and back in.  
7. That should be everything! You can check with if the textures are loaded by looking at a `Titan Tool`.  
8. Keep an eye out for new resource pack version releases to stay up to date!
